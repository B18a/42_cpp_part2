When to Use Which Container

Use vector for fast random access & frequent element access.
Use list for frequent insertions/deletions at arbitrary positions.
Use deque for insertions/deletions at both ends.
Use queue for FIFO behavior.
Use stack for LIFO behavior.
Use set when sorted unique elements are needed.
Use map when you need sorted key-value pairs.
Choosing Between map and unordered_map

map (Red-Black Tree) → Sorted keys (O(log n))
unordered_map (Hash Table) → Faster lookup (O(1)) but unordered
Choosing Between set and unordered_set

set → Ordered elements (O(log n))
unordered_set → Faster lookup (O(1)) but unordered
