General Guidelines
std::array: Best when you need a fixed-size array that is known at compile time. Provides random access but lacks flexibility compared to other containers.
std::vector: Best for dynamic arrays where you need efficient random access and the ability to resize the container.
std::deque: Similar to std::vector, but optimized for insertions/removals at both ends.
std::list: Best for frequent insertions/removals at both ends or middle (due to doubly linked list structure).
std::map: Best for sorted key-value pairs, with efficient searching by key.
std::queue: Best for FIFO (first in, first out) data structure.
std::stack: Best for LIFO (last in, first out) data structure.

Specific Functions for Each Container
1. std::array (Fixed-size Array)
at():
Provides bounds-checked access to elements (throws an exception if out of bounds).
[] operator:
Provides unchecked access (faster but unsafe).
front():
Accesses the first element.
back():
Accesses the last element.
Unique to Array:
Fixed size: The size is determined at compile time and cannot be changed.
data(): Returns a pointer to the underlying array (to access the raw array).
fill(): Fills the array with a specified value.

2. std::vector
push_back():
Adds an element to the end.
pop_back():
Removes the last element.
resize():
Changes the size of the vector.
at():
Provides bounds-checked access to elements.
[] operator:
Provides unchecked access.
Unique to Vector:
reserve(): Pre-allocates memory to avoid repeated reallocations.
shrink_to_fit(): Reduces the capacity of the vector to fit its size.

3. std::deque (Double-ended Queue)
push_front():
Adds an element at the front.
pop_front():
Removes the first element.
push_back():
Adds an element to the end (like vector).
pop_back():
Removes the last element (like vector).
Unique to Deque:

Allows efficient operations on both ends with O(1) time complexity for push_front/pop_front and push_back/pop_back.
4. std::list (Doubly Linked List)
push_front():
Adds an element at the front.
pop_front():
Removes the first element.
push_back():
Adds an element to the end.
pop_back():
Removes the last element.
Unique to List:
Bidirectional traversal: Unlike vector or deque, list provides more flexible traversal since itâ€™s doubly linked (you can go forward or backward easily).
insert(): Can insert at arbitrary positions (requires iterators).
erase(): Can remove elements at specific positions.

5. std::map (Associative Container - Sorted Key-Value Pairs)
insert():
Inserts a key-value pair.
erase():
Removes a key-value pair.
find():
Finds a key-value pair by key.
count():
Counts occurrences of a key (usually 0 or 1 for maps).
operator[]:
Accesses or inserts an element by key.
begin() / end():
Iterates through the map, where each element is a pair (key, value).
Unique to Map:
lower_bound() / upper_bound(): Finds the first key not less than or greater than a given key, respectively.
at(): Access a key-value pair with bounds checking.

6. std::queue
push():
Adds an element to the back of the queue.
pop():
Removes the front element.
front():
Accesses the front element.
back():
Accesses the last element.
Unique to Queue:
FIFO (First In, First Out) structure: Operations follow FIFO order (push at back, pop from front).
empty() and size() are available but not meant for element access.

7. std::stack
push():
Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop():
Removes the top element.
top():
Accesses the top element.
Unique to Stack:
LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure: Operations follow LIFO order (push at top, pop from top).
Like a queue, empty() and size() are available but it's meant for accessing and manipulating only the top element.
